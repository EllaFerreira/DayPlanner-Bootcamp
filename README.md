# DayPlanner-Bootcamp üçç

One of the biggest conflicts of generation is managing time with all the many activities that we have on a daily basis, why not create a plan of the day, with a button to save your plans in local storage and delete when convenient.
In this project I had the opportunity to put JSON and parse into practice; Using moment.js it was possible to create a current day display, as the timeblocks in business hours. 


# Acceptance Criteria

- GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
- WHEN I open the planner
- THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
- WHEN I scroll down
- THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
- WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
- THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
- WHEN I click into a timeblock
- THEN I can enter an event
- WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
- THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
- WHEN I refresh the page
- THEN the saved events persist

# Bonus: 

- WHEN I click on 'delete' button the userInput is deleted from myPlan.
