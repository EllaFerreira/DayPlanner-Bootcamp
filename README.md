# DayPlanner-Bootcamp

Time management plays an important role in the life of a Web Developer  professional. As a person with a very busy schedule I decided to build this daily planner to help me keep on track with my daily tasks. It's an application built with HTML, CSS and Jquery . The texts areas change color according to the time of the day.


#Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule

WHEN I open the planner

THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar

WHEN I scroll down

THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours

WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day

THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future

WHEN I click into a timeblock

THEN I can enter an event

WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock

THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage

WHEN I refresh the page

THEN the saved events persist
